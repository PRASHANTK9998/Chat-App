# Chat-App

A Real Time chat application has been developed, integrating cutting-edge features to ensure seamless communication.  Users can have rapid exchanges and dynamic conversations by utilising Socket.io's real-time messaging features. React.js, HTML, and CSS are used for frontend development to ensure an easy-to-use interface, and Node.js with Express powers the backend to enable effective data processing and management. The application places a high priority on security measures. MongoDB provides scalable and flexible data storage solutions to meet storage needs. The programme uses bcrypt for secure authentication to protect sensitive data and strengthen user privacy. This ensures that user identities are kept secure. Future plans call for adding video chat capability and extending functionality to support QR codes in order to further improve userÂ experience.
